		<h2>What Had Gotten Me into it...</h2>
				<p>Nana is an anime/manga series by Ai Yazawa that is part of the Josei drama (an anime/manga series targeted towards adult women). I had gotten into Nana when lockdown first hit because my friend wanted to watch it with me. Although I still haven't finished the anime, I thoroughly enjoy it so far and find it very satisfying.</p>

		<h2>Three Things I liked about it...</h2>
				<p>1.) I liked the characters because of how relatable they are. My favorite character is Nana "Hachi" Kamatsou because I especially related to her insecurities and thoughts throughout the story.</p>

				<p>2.) I liked the fashion in Nana because a lot of it is very punkish, girly, or vintage inspired which I do love. Nana also uses the brand Vivienne Westwood A LOT. So much so that now whenever I think of Vivienne Westwood, I think of Nana.</p>

				<p>3.) I liked the themes within in the story. Especially themes regarding relationships and dreams. For dreams, the main one was that your dreams may come true, but will look nothing like you had imagined. For relationships, I liked how it showed the nuances within femaile friendships or just friendships in general (feeling left out, going through it all, etc).</p>
