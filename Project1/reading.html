	<h2>What Had Gotten Me into it...</h2>
		<p>I had been an avid reader since elementry school. I would make frequent trips to the library every week carrying a large stack of books with stories to fill my mind. At first, I had read mostly tradiontal story/chapter books until highschool is where I was introduced to comics/graphic novels/manga. Although I haven't been reading much anymore lately, when I do I really enjoy it!</p>
		
	<h2>Three Things I like about it...</h2>
		<p> 1.) I like that reading has inspired me artistically through drawing and writing. Without it, I would have never have been this deeply passionate for either of those hobbies.	
		</p>

		<p>2.) I like looking at the different art styles when reading graphic novels/comics/manga, mostly because sometimes I implement style choices I like into my art!</p>

		<p>3.) I like being able to dive into another world with it's own set of rules and standards as weird as that sounds. Especially in fantasy stories with power levels and social classes!</p>
