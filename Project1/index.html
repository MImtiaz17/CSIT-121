	<h2>Hi, Hello, and As-salamu alaykum...</h2>
		<p>My name is Maheen, and here is my Three Things Project! This is a webpage that I'm using to not only show you my three favorite things, but to practice what I have learned as well in CSIT 121!</p>
	<h2>Three Things About me...</h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>I am currently an Information Technology major at CCBC. I wanted to do IT because I think it's both a practical and financially secure field. Although, I don't expect to be rolling in dough.</li>
				<li>I am currently on a journey to improve my health both physcially and mentally! This past decade has been a rollarcoaster, but I'm still greatful to be where I am today.</li>
				<li>I have currently traveled to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Canada, UAE, and the east coast. I do plan on travelling to more countries soon! This summer I'm visiting Pakistan after 2 years which is both unexpected yet exciting!</li>
