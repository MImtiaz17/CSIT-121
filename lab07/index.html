	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Cucumbers, ideally Persian cucumbers but regular works fine</li>
			<li>Tomatoes, ideally firm ones (Ex:Roma) but any tomatoes work </li>
			<li>Red Onion </li>
			<li>Fresh herbs, Cilantro and Parsley are commonly used either or both. Dried mint is also used, pick what you prefer </li>
			<li>Dressing
				<ul>
					<li>extra vigin olive oil</li>
					<li>lime juice</li>
					<li>salt and pepper</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Dice/chop all of the ingredients (minus the dressing) and make them unifrom</li>
    			<li>For the dressing, its recommended to whisk all the dressing ingredients together in the serving bowl, and then add the salad ingredients and toss for less cleanup</li>
		</ol>

	<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
		<ol>
    		<li><b>De-seed tomatoes for ideal results:</b> there's a lot of water in tomatoes especially when diced. So if you have the time, remove the seeds and save it for something else.</li>
    		<li><b>Chop everything evenly:</b> It helps making your salad look good and make bites more enjoyable.</li>
    		<li><b>Toss salad immediately before serving:</b> The salad should be fresh and crunchy, so tossing it right away gives the best results.</li>
    		<li><b>Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and lime juice:</b> Depending on size and taste of the salad, you may need to adjust to your liking.</li>

	<h2>Why This Recipe</h2>
	<p>Lately I've been trying to eat healthier and wanted to try making salads. But I was never really a salad person aside from eating chana chaat (Pakistani appetizer). I wanted an easy salad that I can both make last minute when guests come over and a salad that still fits within my current palete as someone who primarily eats Pakistani food. So, after researching a bit, I've found one (this recipe) that I liked the most and now use often. I hope you like it!</p>
